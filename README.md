# jspak

A sample project where we hook up Bower to RequireJS and Bower to
Buster.JS, using Grunt.

You need to have nodejs, npm, bower, grunt, buster and PhantomJS
installed.

Installation:

    $ npm install

Install client-side dependencies:

    $ bower install

Run the tests with buster (and PhantomJS):

    $ grunt test
