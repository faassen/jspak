* Have to put 'test' directory under 'src' otherwise it won't work somehow.

* have to explicitly list components/jquery/*.js in sources in buster.js;
  components/**/*.js gets too much. This is going to be cumbersome if
  we have a number of dependencies.

* still need to figure out how to install all dependencies (npm and
  bower) automatically somehow...

The goals:

src directory with obviel modules in it:

src/core.js
src/template.js

Produce one "everything" js file out of this, or alternatively 
use smaller files directly? or multiple productions?

Refer to these in requirejs using:

"obviel/core"


test directory with test modules in it:

src/test-core.js
src/test-template.js

components directory with bower components in it

don't include external components in produced obviel.js

when a bower component is installed, automatically make it available
to requirejs

buster.js should have multiple test groups so tests can be run separately

buster.js should use phantomjs by default so tests can be run right away,
but allow debugging using firebug.

should not have to list requirejs dependencies in buster.js



dependency list for components (components.json?)  dependency list for
package.json - does this only have dev deps?
